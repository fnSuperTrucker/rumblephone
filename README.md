Here's how to install the Rumble PWA on your Android phone using Brave Browser:

Open the Link in Brave: On your Android phone, open the Brave browser and go to the provided URL: https://fnsupertrucker.github.io/rumblephone/

Access Brave's Menu: Once the page has loaded, tap on the three vertical dots (menu icon) in the bottom right corner of the Brave browser screen.

Find the "Install App" Option: In the menu that appears, look for an option that says "Install app" or possibly "Add to Home screen." Tap on this option.

Confirm Installation: A prompt will appear asking you to confirm adding the app to your home screen. Tap "Install" or "Add" on this prompt.


After completing these steps, the Rumble Launcher PWA icon will be added to your Android phone's home screen. When you tap this icon, it will open 
the PWA, which then redirects you to Rumble.com as intended by your index.html.
